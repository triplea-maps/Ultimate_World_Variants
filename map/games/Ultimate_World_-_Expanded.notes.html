I recently downloaded and played  the Ultimate Pants mod and I enjoyed the number of Nations there were and decided to expand on  that. What I came up with, I shall Call Ultimate World - Expanded, the unit stats are very  different then the original Ultimate world but I believe it adds greatly to the gameplay  creating a historically accurate and balanced game. <br> <br> I focused on a veriety of ways to make this map play out historically accurate. One  objective I was trying to achieve was to make the battle of the atlantic much more about  submarines. To do this I tried a veriety of ways; I tried making subs 2 hits so that it  makes them harder to destroy, I tried making them move faster so that their movements  would be less predictable, I tried changing the destroyer: by removing its destroyer  ability (of which I added to the S_destroyer in the original Ultimate World), I tried  making the destroyer move slow and change it so that it was mainly a defensive unit: a sort  of Jack of all trades if you will, I finally came to what is in this game using most of  these ideas.<br> <br> Another way I tried was to make smaller nations be able to defend agienst larger nations. What I came up with here was include a few new units, such as the conscript which is specifically  designed for defense as well as the bunker which enhances ones defencive capabilities, I  also changed artillery to be more defensive. For the sea, I included the local-t (stands for  local transportation), which allows you to tranfer men from 1 side of a seazone to the  other but also is 2-hit, allowing you to use it more as a safezone for your fleet as well.  All these things make defending much cheaper then attacking, though you wont be able to  transfer these defensive capabilities to offensive capabilities very well as these defencive  units dont move fast and have a low or even no attack.<br> <br> The third way, was to make planes a more viable options for attacking things, so that things  like the Battle of Britian and Pearl Harbour can play out without other forces. I did this by  making fighters 2-hit units, allowing them to attack targets without fear of being unlucky  and shot down.<br> <br> The last way was to divide up the nations even more and add in nations that would be conquered  easily so that their production would go to who needs it (and France can actually survive for  quite a while if your not careful Germany). I did this so that certian areas will be fought over in  certian ways rather then be at the end of a supply line. <br> <br> Well I hope you enjoy my revision of Ultimate world and remember Big World may be big but Ultimate world is <br> <br> ULTIMATE!!!<br>
